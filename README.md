# Barclays-Question

One problem solving question. Need to solve it in 35 minutes. For me problem statement was as below:

Input String: 1234567890
Output: 1029384756

Input: 130
Output: 103



Input: 1012
Output: 1201

Output should be a sequence of characters where first character would be coming from left side of the input string and next character would be from right side of the string.
